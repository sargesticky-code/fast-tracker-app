-- Phase 2: preserve exactly 12 Supabase snapshot reads per hour and the
-- existing Railway 15-minute bookmaker capture, while shifting the read phase.
--
-- Observed production collector completes at ~:04/:19/:34/:49 UTC.
-- Original cron job 38 starts at :03/:08/...; pg_net response is published
-- the NEXT 5-minute cycle: e.g. 02:04:20 capture -> 02:13:00 commit (8m40).
-- Phase-aligning to :01/:06/... should produce ~:11 commit (~6m40),
-- without adding any HTTP requests or changing 20-minute source freshness.
--
-- Guard the exact job ID, original schedule and command; this is an in-place
-- update, not an additional cron entry or a second odds collector.
-- If the baseline changes, fail safely instead of overriding another operator.
